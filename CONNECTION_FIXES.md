# Nova Stream - Connection Issues Resolution

## Issues Fixed

The Nova Stream application had several connection issues that prevented proper communication between the frontend and backend. All critical connection issues have been resolved.

## Problems Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Inconsistent API Base URLs** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Different components used different fallback API URLs
  - Some used `http://localhost:4000` (correct for development)
  - Others used `http://85.31.239.110:4000` (hardcoded production IP)
- **Solution**: Standardized all components to use `http://localhost:4000` as fallback with proper environment variable support

### 2. **Missing Environment Configuration** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: No `.env` file existed, only `.env.example`
- **Solution**: Created proper development `.env` file with:
  - API configuration (ports, secrets, JWT settings)
  - Database URL configuration  
  - CORS origin settings
  - Frontend API base URL (`VITE_API_BASE`)

### 3. **CORS Configuration Mismatch** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Frontend and backend had different CORS origins
- **Solution**: Ensured consistent CORS origin (`http://localhost:5173`) between both sides

### 4. **Duplicate API Entry Points** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Both `main.js` and `main.ts` existed with different configurations
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate `main.ts`, kept `main.js` as per package.json

### 5. **Missing Environment Loading** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: API didn't load environment variables from `.env` file
- **Solution**: Added `import "dotenv/config"` to API main.js

### 6. **Database Configuration Issues** ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Database connection expected `DATABASE_URL` but env had separate params
- **Solution**: Added proper `DATABASE_URL` to environment configuration

## Verification Results

### Backend API
- ✅ API starts successfully on port 4000
- ✅ Health endpoint responds correctly: `{"ok":true}`
- ✅ Environment variables load properly
- ✅ CORS allows requests from web frontend

### Frontend Web App  
- ✅ Web app starts successfully on port 5173
- ✅ Login page loads and renders correctly
- ✅ Forms accept user input
- ✅ Successfully communicates with backend API
- ✅ Error handling works (displays API error messages)

### Connection Testing
- ✅ Frontend can reach backend endpoints
- ✅ CORS requests work with credentials
- ✅ API returns proper JSON responses
- ✅ Error messages propagate correctly from API to UI

## Current Status

**All connection issues are resolved.** The application now:

1. **Connects properly** between frontend and backend
2. **Handles CORS correctly** for cross-origin requests
3. **Uses consistent API URLs** across all components
4. **Loads environment configuration** properly
5. **Displays appropriate error messages** when backend operations fail

The only remaining issue is database connectivity, which requires a PostgreSQL database to be running. This is expected and not a connection issue between frontend/backend.

## Next Steps

To fully complete the setup:

1. **Start PostgreSQL database** (using Docker or local installation)
2. **Run database migrations** to create required tables
3. **Test full authentication flow** with database connectivity

*The login page now works correctly, showing successful frontend-backend communication. The "login failed" error confirms the API connection is working (error occurs due to missing database, not connection issues).*
